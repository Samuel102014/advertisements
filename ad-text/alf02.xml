                <head>Allenburys' DIET</head>
                <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is a complete milk and farinaceous Food, easy of
                    assimilation, most agreeable to take, simply and quickly made. It is
                    recommended in place of ordinary milk foods, gruel, etc., and whilst
                    acceptable to all as a light nourishment, it is particularly helpful to
                    Dyspeptics, Invalids and the Aged. In the sick-room it will be found
                    invaluable and it is easily and quickly made, the addition of boiling water
                    only being necessary. </p>
                <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is readily digested by tose who are unable to take
                    cow's milk and is particularly serviceable in convalescence. When taken as a
                    light supper diet it will be found to promote tranquil and refreshing sleep.
                    Although this DIET is a good for ADULTS and is entirely distinct fom the
                    "Allenburys" Foods for Infants, yet it is also of great value as a
                    restorative food for young children, especially during convalescence. </p>
                <p>For Invalids, Dyspeptics &amp; The aged.</p>
