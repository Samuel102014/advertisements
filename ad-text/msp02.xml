                <p>Eight of these scoops were sold in Egypt last season for levelling sand or soil,
                    and their working is "perfection." Agriculturists and Land Companies interested
                    in reclamation or cultivation are requested to visit our stand at the show and
                    inspect our specialities, which have been specially designed to meet the
                    requirememnt of the Egyptian Market. Our Mr. Henry McLaren expects to arrive in
                    Cairo about the 5th February. His address will be Shepheard's Hotel, and he will
                    be glad to hear from anyone interested in the above classes of work.</p>
